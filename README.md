# docker-compose-laravel

A pretty simplified Docker Compose workflow that sets up a LEMP network of containers for local Laravel development. You can view the full article that inspired this repo [here](https://dev.to/aschmelyun/the-beauty-of-docker-for-local-laravel-development-13c0).

## Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) on your system, and then click on button 'Use this template'.

Next, navigate in your terminal to the directory you cloned this, and spin up the containers for the web server by running:

```dosini
docker-compose up -d --build web
```

After that completes, follow the steps from the [src/README.md](src/README.md) file to get your Laravel project added in (or create a new blank one).

**Note**: Update src/.env file environment variables

```dosini
APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret

CACHE_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=redis

REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

Bringing up the Docker Compose network with `app` instead of just using `up`, ensures that only our site's containers are brought up at the start, instead of all of the command containers as well. The following are built for our web server, with their exposed ports detailed:

- **nginx** - `:8000`
- **mysql** - `:3306`
- **php** - `:9000`
- **redis** - `:6379`
- **mailhog** - `:8025` 

To use a database access client in the local environment, you can use the following container:

```dosini
docker-compose up -d phpmyadmin
```

- **phpMyAdmin** - `:8001`

Three additional containers are included that handle NPM commands *without* having to have these platforms installed on your local computer. Use the following command examples from your project root, modifying them to fit your particular use case.

```dosini
docker-compose run --rm npm run dev
```

## Permissions Issues

If you encounter any issues with filesystem permissions while visiting your application or running a container command, try completing one of the sets of steps below.

**If you are using your server or local environment as the root user:**

- Bring any container(s) down with:

```dosini
`docker-compose down`
```

- Replace any instance of `Dockerfile` in the docker-compose.yml file with `root.Dockerfile`
- Re-build the containers by running:

```dosini
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**If you are using your server or local environment as a user that is not root:**

- Bring any container(s) down with:

```dosini
`docker-compose down`
```

- In your terminal, run `export UID=$(id -u)` and then `export GID=$(id -g)`
- If you see any errors about readonly variables from the above step, you can ignore them and continue
- Re-build the containers by running:

```dosini
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

Then, either bring back up your container network or re-run the command you were trying before, and see if that fixes it.

## Usage in Production

While I originally created this template for local development, it's robust enough to be used in basic Laravel application deployments. The biggest recommendation would be to ensure that HTTPS is enabled by making additions to the `nginx/default.conf` file and utilizing something like [Let's Encrypt](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/letsencrypt) to produce an SSL certificate.

## Compiling Assets

This configuration should be able to compile assets with both [laravel mix](https://laravel-mix.com/) and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). In order to get started, you first need to add ` --host 0.0.0.0` after the end of your relevant dev command in `package.json`. So for example, with a Laravel project using Vite, you should see:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite --host 0.0.0.0",
  "build": "vite build"
},
```

Then, run the following commands to install your dependencies and start the dev server:

```dosini
docker-compose run --rm npm install
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports npm run dev
```

After that, you should be able to use `@vite` directives to enable hot-module reloading on your local Laravel application.

Want to build for production? Simply run

```dosini
docker-compose run --rm npm run build
```

## MailHog

The current version of Laravel (10 as of today) uses MailHog as the default application for testing email sending and general SMTP work during local development. Using the provided Docker Hub image, getting an instance set up and ready is simple and straight-forward. The service is included in the `docker-compose.yml` file, and spins up alongside the webserver and database services.

To see the dashboard and view any emails coming through the system, visit [localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) after running

```dosini
docker-compose up -d mailhog
```
